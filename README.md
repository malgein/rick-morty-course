This is a project that consists of an interface, which the user, when interacting with, can obtain information about the rick and morty tv series.

Made with React js and create react app, this project makes use of the most basic elements of the aforementioned javascript library. From the use of props, hooks, components, api fetch and more.

Perhaps the most striking thing about the project is that it executes a call to an api in real time of the TV series and it is the one that gives us all the information that we see here, characters of the series, number of chapters and their appearances in them, status current status of the character, their species, number of episodes, an image for each element in the database and more.

A simple project that demonstrates basic react js skills by doing something different.
